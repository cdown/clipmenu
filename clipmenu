clipmenu is a simple clipboard manager using dmenu and xsel. Launch this
when you want to select a clip.

All arguments are passed through to dmenu itself.

Environment variables:

- $CM_LAUNCHER: specify a dmenu-compatible launcher (default: dmenu)
- $TMPDIR: specify the base directory to store the cache dir in (default: /tmp)

    exit 0

    # rofi supports dmenu-like arguments through the -dmenu flag
    set -- -dmenu "$@"
fi

# It's okay to hardcode `-l 8` here as a sensible default without checking
# whether `-l` is also in "$@", because the way that dmenu works allows a later
# argument to override an earlier one. That is, if the user passes in `-l`, our
# one will be ignored.
