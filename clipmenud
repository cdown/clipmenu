clipmenud is the daemon that collects and caches what's on the clipboard.
when you want to select a clip.

Environment variables:

- $CM_ONESHOT: run once immediately, do not loop (default: 0)
- $CM_DEBUG: turn on debugging output (default: 0)
- $CM_OWN_CLIPBOARD: take ownership of the clipboard (default: 1)
- $TMPDIR: specify the base directory to store the cache dir in (default: /tmp)
